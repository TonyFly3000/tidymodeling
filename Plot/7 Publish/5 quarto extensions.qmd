Extensions are a powerful way to modify and extend the behavior of Quarto. Quarto v1.2 Required for Quarto Extensions.

# quarto extensionï¼š lightbox

An extension that uses the GLightbox javascript library to add lightbox styling and behavior to images in your HTML documents.

# Installation:
```{bach filename="Terminal"}
quarto install extension quarto-ext/lightbox
```

# Usage:

The Lightbox extension can automatically give images in your web page a lightbox treatment. You can enable this like:

in header yaml:

```{r}
#| eval: false
---
title: Simple Lightbox Example
filters:
   - lightbox
lightbox: auto
---

```

In addition to simply providing a lightbox treatment for individual images, you can also group images into a 'gallery'. When the user activates the lightbox, they will be able to page through the images in the gallery without returning to the main document.

in content:

```{r}
#| eval: false
![](images/image-562149792.png){group="my-gallery"
description="its a picture"}
```
