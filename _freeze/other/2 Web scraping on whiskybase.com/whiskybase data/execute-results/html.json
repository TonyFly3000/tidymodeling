We reach whisky enthusiasts and whisky professionals in nearly every country at all stages of their whisky journey.\n\nMillions of people use Whiskybase.com to look up their whisky bottles, organize a collection, plan a whisky event, or document their whisky experiences by adding ratings, reviews, and more to our whisky database, the world’s largest.\n\n# rvest package\n\nrvest helps you scrape (or harvest) data from web pages. It is designed to work with magrittr to make it easy to express common web scraping tasks, inspired by libraries like beautiful soup and RoboBrowser.\n\nIf you’re scraping multiple pages, I highly recommend using rvest in concert with polite. The polite package ensures that you’re respecting the robots.txt and not hammering the site with too many requests.\n\n![](images/clipboard-1520421631.png){width=\"500\"}\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(rvest)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npackageVersion(\"rvest\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] '1.0.4'\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n# reference:\n",
