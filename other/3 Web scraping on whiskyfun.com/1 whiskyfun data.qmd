# whiskyfun data

I’m just an amateur whisky lover and I live in a part of France called Alsace, near the German border. I co-own two advertising agencies (200 people). I insist, I’m not a whisky pro, not even a proam. I like to talk about whisky with my friends the Malt Maniacs (and many other friends) but what I like best is tasting whisky. I do all that for fun, just for fun. I think whisky is serious matter only to people who make or sell it – or to people who drink way too much of it. What’s more, I like many other things, like all kinds of music, advertising (my work), motorcycling, wine, old watches, food, travelling and God knows what else. You know, toys for boys. And yes, friends… And last time I checked I was 49, happily married, three lovely children (who drink no whisky).----Serge Valentin
