Show in original language

A deep and generous whisky, brilliantly offering the shades of an exclusive aging in sherry barrels.
Nose
85 85
Complex, fresh and fruity.
Taste
87 87
Creamy and round, surprisingly sweet, notes of dried fruit, spices like vanilla taking time to appear.
Finish
89 89
Woody and spicy with a return of dried fruit that lingers pleasantly in length.

Show in original language

A deep and generous whisky, brilliantly offering the shades of an exclusive aging in sherry barrels.
Nose
85 85
Complex, fresh and fruity.
Taste
87 87
Creamy and round, surprisingly sweet, notes of dried fruit, spices like vanilla taking time to appear.
Finish
89 89
Woody and spicy with a return of dried fruit that lingers pleasantly in length.

Show in original language

A deep and generous whisky, brilliantly offering the shades of an exclusive aging in sherry barrels.
Nose
85 85
Complex, fresh and fruity.
Taste
87 87
Creamy and round, surprisingly sweet, notes of dried fruit, spices like vanilla taking time to appear.
Finish
89 89
Woody and spicy with a return of dried fruit that lingers pleasantly in length.

These General Terms and Conditions (“Terms”), as well as our Privacy Statement (“Privacy Statement”), apply to your (“you”, “Member”) use of the Service (which includes visits to the Whiskybase websites).

By using our website(s) and registering for the Service, you expressly confirm acknowledgment and acceptance of the Terms and agree to be bound by them.

Our Service, age restrictions

Our Service is an online platform which provides Members with information (e.g. bottle facts, market-indices, market values and prices) on (mostly) whisky and allows Members to add information to the platform.

Each and every Member must be of legal drinking age in its country of residence to be allowed to use the Service. If no such law exists in a Member’s country of residence, the Member has to be over 21 years old to use the Service.

l3oris scored this whisky 87 points
01 mar 2020 2:17 pm

Show in original language

A deep and generous whisky, brilliantly offering the shades of an exclusive aging in sherry barrels.
Nose
85 85
Complex, fresh and fruity.
Taste
87 87
Creamy and round, surprisingly sweet, notes of dried fruit, spices like vanilla taking time to appear.
Finish
89 89
Woody and spicy with a return of dried fruit that lingers pleasantly in length.

A deep and generous whisky, brilliantly offering the shades of an exclusive aging in sherry barrels.
Nose
85 85
Complex, fresh and fruity.
Taste
87 87
Creamy and round, surprisingly sweet, notes of dried fruit, spices like vanilla taking time to appear.
Finish
89 89
Woody and spicy with a return of dried fruit that lingers pleasantly in length.

Whiskybase General Terms and Conditions

Introduction

Whiskybase B.V. (“Whiskybase”, “we” or “us”, company details below) offers a whisky enthusiasts online platform that provides its members access to the most comprehensive, transparent and trusted resource of whisky bottles and allows and stimulates its members to contribute information about whisky bottles to the platform (“Service”). 

These General Terms and Conditions (“Terms”), as well as our Privacy Statement (“Privacy Statement”), apply to your (“you”, “Member”) use of the Service (which includes visits to the Whiskybase websites).

By using our website(s) and registering for the Service, you expressly confirm acknowledgment and acceptance of the Terms and agree to be bound by them.

Our Service, age restrictions

Our Service is an online platform which provides Members with information (e.g. bottle facts, market-indices, market values and prices) on (mostly) whisky and allows Members to add information to the platform. We do not sell, nor does the Service provide any option to buy, any alcoholic products. 

Each and every Member must be of legal drinking age in its country of residence to be allowed to use the Service. If no such law exists in a Member’s country of residence, the Member has to be over 21 years old to use the Service. We have the right to ask you to provide proof of your age and/or to provide further identification to prevent underage usage and/or for any other legal or legitimate purpose. By using the Service, and by creating an account you represent, warrant and confirm that you are of legal age.

You acknowledge that the Service is protected by copyrights and database rights. The Service and your account are for your personal use only and may not be shared with any third parties. We grant to registered Members a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable right to access and use the Service and to view its contents (“License”). Without limiting the foregoing, the License does not include (a) the right to resell or use the Service commercially (unless explicitly allowed under the applicable subscription plan), (b) the right to make the Service publicly available or use for public display, (c) any downloading, duplicating, or copying, collection and use of any contents of the Services, e.g. bottle information, descriptions, ratings, retail and secondary market price observations, values, etc., (d) the right to license, use, sell, archive, reproduce, distribute, modify, perform, publish, create derivative works from, offer for sale, or use of the Service. Further, you shall not circumvent, remove, alter, deactivate, degrade or thwart any of the content protections, decompile, reverse engineer or disassemble the Service and any software related to or used in or by the Service.

Without prejudice to the section Liability below, the Service may be temporarily unavailable during maintenance, updates, etc. We shall make reasonable efforts to inform you of any unavailability due to maintenance or updates.

Member registration and accounts

You must create an account to be able to use our Service where the following personal information is required: username, a valid email address, country of residence and a password. Additional personal information may be provided by you if you wish to do so. Please read our Privacy Statement for more information on our use and processing of your personal information.

You are responsible for all activities through your account. You are responsible for the accuracy of the information you provide to us in relation to your account, and for updating it where necessary. You are not allowed to create multiple accounts. We may terminate or temporarily suspend your account to protect you, ourselves or our partners from (suspected) identity theft or other (suspected) fraudulent (e.g. false, misleading, deceptive) activity. You have the obligation to keep your login credentials confidential. You shall not authorize any others to use or access your account.

Termination

You may terminate your account at any time. If you terminate your account, you will no longer have access to the Service and your Contributions (specified below), if any. We do not provide back-ups of your Contributions. To terminate your account, login to your account, go to the “settings page”, and follow the termination instructions]. If you cancel your subscription, your account will be automatically closed.

We reserve the right to immediately and without prior notice deactivate, suspend and/or terminate your account if you do not abide by the Terms, if you act unlawful, if you do not act or use the Service in good faith, or if you cause any harm whatsoever to the Service, to other Members, to other persons or to us. You shall be notified of the deactivation, suspension, or termination via the email address linked to your account.

Member behavior and Member contributions 

We do not allow the sale and/or purchase of products between members through the Service, e.g. through private messages. If you wish to sell or purchase products, please refer to the Whiskybase Market.
