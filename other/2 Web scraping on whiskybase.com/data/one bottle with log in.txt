Dried fruit scent and sherry scent go well with sweet vanilla and smoky woody scent

Nose
84 84
Dried plums, dried fruit, fine vanilla, caramel sweet sugar.
Taste
84 84
ried fruit. bland sugar.
Oily compared to 40 degrees ABV.
It's not that sweet compared to the scent, but the sweetness balances out the slight bitterness. (about 7:3)
Finish
83 83
The slight sweetness and astringency pass very cleanly and quickly.
It ends cleanly with a spicy spice feel at the end.

very good fresh citrusy sherry oak, very classy despite the watered down mouthfeel, too bad it drinks like a cocktail
Nose
88 88
candied toasted orange peel panettone dough, sweet gummy bears
Taste
73 73
some classy cocktail made with sherry oak whisky carrying most of the nose bouquet to the palate but diluted with a glass of low minerality water, for good measure
Finish
77 77
orange zest spiced oak wood, diluted of course

A relaxing sherry barrel with a gorgeous apple aroma, sweetness, and astringency.

Show in original language

Pleasantly soft, but also somewhat uncharacteristic everyday whisky at a high level.
Nose
87 87
Complex nose with lacquer, shoe polish, dried apricot, Brazil nut, marzipan, raisins, leather, dark cherry, chamomile, orange blossom, pleasantly spicy overall.
Taste
83 83
Despite the 40%, the start is initially mouth-filling, pleasantly soft with apricot, caramel, but then nothing comes, it is a nice short flare-up of a sweet, spicy maltiness, which then quickly subsides.
Finish
84 84
Becoming drier, also astringent, dry sherry notes

Dried fruit scent and sherry scent go well with sweet vanilla and smoky woody scent

Nose

Dried plums, dried fruit, fine vanilla, caramel sweet sugar.
Taste
84 84
ried fruit. bland sugar.
Oily compared to 40 degrees ABV.
It's not that sweet compared to the scent, but the sweetness balances out the slight bitterness. (about 7:3)
Finish
83 83
The slight sweetness and astringency pass very cleanly and quickly.
It ends cleanly with a spicy spice feel at the end.

very good fresh citrusy sherry oak, very classy despite the watered down mouthfeel, too bad it drinks like a cocktail
Nose
88 88
candied toasted orange peel panettone dough, sweet gummy bears
Taste
73 73
some classy cocktail made with sherry oak whisky carrying most of the nose bouquet to the palate but diluted with a glass of low minerality water, for good measure
Finish
77 77
orange zest spiced oak wood, diluted of course

A relaxing sherry barrel with a gorgeous apple aroma, sweetness, and astringency.

Show in original language

Pleasantly soft, but also somewhat uncharacteristic everyday whisky at a high level.
Nose
87 87
Complex nose with lacquer, shoe polish, dried apricot, Brazil nut, marzipan, raisins, leather, dark cherry, chamomile, orange blossom, pleasantly spicy overall.
Taste
83 83
Despite the 40%, the start is initially mouth-filling, pleasantly soft with apricot, caramel, but then nothing comes, it is a nice short flare-up of a sweet, spicy maltiness, which then quickly subsides.
Finish
84 84
Becoming drier, also astringent, dry sherry notes

Nose

Dried plums, dried fruit, fine vanilla, caramel sweet sugar.
Taste
84 84
ried fruit. bland sugar.
Oily compared to 40 degrees ABV.
It's not that sweet compared to the scent, but the sweetness balances out the slight bitterness. (about 7:3)
Finish
83 83
The slight sweetness and astringency pass very cleanly and quickly.
It ends cleanly with a spicy spice feel at the end.

very good fresh citrusy sherry oak, very classy despite the watered down mouthfeel, too bad it drinks like a cocktail
Nose
88 88
candied toasted orange peel panettone dough, sweet gummy bears
Taste
73 73
some classy cocktail made with sherry oak whisky carrying most of the nose bouquet to the palate but diluted with a glass of low minerality water, for good measure
Finish
77 77
orange zest spiced oak wood, diluted of course

A relaxing sherry barrel with a gorgeous apple aroma, sweetness, and astringency.

Show in original language

Pleasantly soft, but also somewhat uncharacteristic everyday whisky at a high level.
Nose
87 87
Complex nose with lacquer, shoe polish, dried apricot, Brazil nut, marzipan, raisins, leather, dark cherry, chamomile, orange blossom, pleasantly spicy overall.
Taste
83 83
Despite the 40%, the start is initially mouth-filling, pleasantly soft with apricot, caramel, but then nothing comes, it is a nice short flare-up of a sweet, spicy maltiness, which then quickly subsides.
Finish
84 84
Becoming drier, also astringent, dry sherry notes

Nose

Dried plums, dried fruit, fine vanilla, caramel sweet sugar.
Taste
84 84
ried fruit. bland sugar.
Oily compared to 40 degrees ABV.
It's not that sweet compared to the scent, but the sweetness balances out the slight bitterness. (about 7:3)
Finish
83 83
The slight sweetness and astringency pass very cleanly and quickly.
It ends cleanly with a spicy spice feel at the end.

very good fresh citrusy sherry oak, very classy despite the watered down mouthfeel, too bad it drinks like a cocktail
Nose
88 88
candied toasted orange peel panettone dough, sweet gummy bears
Taste
73 73
some classy cocktail made with sherry oak whisky carrying most of the nose bouquet to the palate but diluted with a glass of low minerality water, for good measure
Finish
77 77
orange zest spiced oak wood, diluted of course

A relaxing sherry barrel with a gorgeous apple aroma, sweetness, and astringency.

Show in original language

Pleasantly soft, but also somewhat uncharacteristic everyday whisky at a high level.
Nose
87 87
Complex nose with lacquer, shoe polish, dried apricot, Brazil nut, marzipan, raisins, leather, dark cherry, chamomile, orange blossom, pleasantly spicy overall.
Taste
83 83
Despite the 40%, the start is initially mouth-filling, pleasantly soft with apricot, caramel, but then nothing comes, it is a nice short flare-up of a sweet, spicy maltiness, which then quickly subsides.
Finish
84 84
Becoming drier, also astringent, dry sherry notes

Nose

Dried plums, dried fruit, fine vanilla, caramel sweet sugar.
Taste
84 84
ried fruit. bland sugar.
Oily compared to 40 degrees ABV.
It's not that sweet compared to the scent, but the sweetness balances out the slight bitterness. (about 7:3)
Finish
83 83
The slight sweetness and astringency pass very cleanly and quickly.
It ends cleanly with a spicy spice feel at the end.

very good fresh citrusy sherry oak, very classy despite the watered down mouthfeel, too bad it drinks like a cocktail
Nose
88 88
candied toasted orange peel panettone dough, sweet gummy bears
Taste
73 73
some classy cocktail made with sherry oak whisky carrying most of the nose bouquet to the palate but diluted with a glass of low minerality water, for good measure
Finish
77 77
orange zest spiced oak wood, diluted of course

A relaxing sherry barrel with a gorgeous apple aroma, sweetness, and astringency.

Show in original language

Pleasantly soft, but also somewhat uncharacteristic everyday whisky at a high level.
Nose
87 87
Complex nose with lacquer, shoe polish, dried apricot, Brazil nut, marzipan, raisins, leather, dark cherry, chamomile, orange blossom, pleasantly spicy overall.
Taste
83 83
Despite the 40%, the start is initially mouth-filling, pleasantly soft with apricot, caramel, but then nothing comes, it is a nice short flare-up of a sweet, spicy maltiness, which then quickly subsides.
Finish
84 84
Becoming drier, also astringent, dry sherry notes

Dried plums, dried fruit, fine vanilla, caramel sweet sugar.
Taste
84 84
ried fruit. bland sugar.
Oily compared to 40 degrees ABV.
It's not that sweet compared to the scent, but the sweetness balances out the slight bitterness. (about 7:3)
Finish
83 83
The slight sweetness and astringency pass very cleanly and quickly.
It ends cleanly with a spicy spice feel at the end.

very good fresh citrusy sherry oak, very classy despite the watered down mouthfeel, too bad it drinks like a cocktail
Nose

candied toasted orange peel panettone dough, sweet gummy bears
Taste

some classy cocktail made with sherry oak whisky carrying most of the nose bouquet to the palate but diluted with a glass of low minerality water, for good measure
Finish

orange zest spiced oak wood, diluted of course

Pleasantly soft, but also somewhat uncharacteristic everyday whisky at a high level.
Nose
87 87
Complex nose with lacquer, shoe polish, dried apricot, Brazil nut, marzipan, raisins, leather, dark cherry, chamomile, orange blossom, pleasantly spicy overall.
Taste
83 83
Despite the 40%, the start is initially mouth-filling, pleasantly soft with apricot, caramel, but then nothing comes, it is a nice short flare-up of a sweet, spicy maltiness, which then quickly subsides.
Finish
84 84
Becoming drier, also astringent, dry sherry notes

Pleasantly soft, but also somewhat uncharacteristic everyday whisky at a high level.
Nose
87 87
Complex nose with lacquer, shoe polish, dried apricot, Brazil nut, marzipan, raisins, leather, dark cherry, chamomile, orange blossom, pleasantly spicy overall.
Taste
83 83
Despite the 40%, the start is initially mouth-filling, pleasantly soft with apricot, caramel, but then nothing comes, it is a nice short flare-up of a sweet, spicy maltiness, which then quickly subsides.
Finish
84 84
Becoming drier, also astringent, dry sherry notes

Nose

Dried plums, dried fruit, fine vanilla, caramel sweet sugar.
Taste
84 84
ried fruit. bland sugar.
Oily compared to 40 degrees ABV.
It's not that sweet compared to the scent, but the sweetness balances out the slight bitterness. (about 7:3)
Finish
83 83
The slight sweetness and astringency pass very cleanly and quickly.
It ends cleanly with a spicy spice feel at the end.

very good fresh citrusy sherry oak, very classy despite the watered down mouthfeel, too bad it drinks like a cocktail
Nose

candied toasted orange peel panettone dough, sweet gummy bears
Taste

some classy cocktail made with sherry oak whisky carrying most of the nose bouquet to the palate but diluted with a glass of low minerality water, for good measure

"PeterBlair scored this whisky 85 points
13 aug 2023 10:11 pm

Show in original language

Pleasantly soft, but also somewhat uncharacteristic everyday whisky at a high level.
Nose
87 87
Complex nose with lacquer, shoe polish, dried apricot, Brazil nut, marzipan, raisins, leather, dark cherry, chamomile, orange blossom, pleasantly spicy overall.
Taste
83 83
Despite the 40%, the start is initially mouth-filling, pleasantly soft with apricot, caramel, but then nothing comes, it is a nice short flare-up of a sweet, spicy maltiness, which then quickly subsides.
Finish
84 84
Becoming drier, also astringent, dry sherry notes
