R is based heavily on the S language, first developed in the 1960s and 1970s by researchers at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey


R’s developers—Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the Univer-
sity of Auckland in New Zealand—released it in the early 1990s under the
 
GNU public license. (The software was named for Ross and Robert’s shared first initial.)
