# Introduction

Look at the hotel booking data.The target variable is whether have children



# Hotel booking data

# data download from github
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

#hotels <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/hotels.csv")

hotels <- readr::read_csv("data/hotels.csv")

```

Data have `r nrow(hotels)` record  and `r ncol(hotels)` variable   
```{r}

glimpse(hotels)
```


```{r}
hotels %>% group_by(children) %>% count()
```
# ploting and EDA

```{r}
hotel_stays <- hotels %>%
  filter(is_canceled == 0) %>%
  mutate(
    children = case_when(
      children + babies > 0 ~ "children",
      TRUE ~ "none"
    ),
    required_car_parking_spaces = case_when(
      required_car_parking_spaces > 0 ~ "parking",
      TRUE ~ "none"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(-is_canceled, -reservation_status, -babies)

```

```{r}
hotel_stays %>%
  mutate(arrival_date_month = factor(arrival_date_month,
    levels = month.name
  )) %>%
  count(hotel, arrival_date_month, children) %>%
  group_by(hotel, children) %>%
  mutate(proportion = n / sum(n)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(arrival_date_month, proportion, fill = children)) +
  geom_col(position = "dodge") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format()) +
  facet_wrap(~hotel, nrow = 2) +
  labs(
    x = NULL,
    y = "Proportion of hotel stays",
    fill = NULL
  )
```


```{r}
hotel_stays %>%
  count(children)
```

```{r}
library(skimr)

skim(hotel_stays)
```


## Measurement:

* Accuracy=TP+TN+FP+FN

* Precision --- Out of all the examples that predicted as positive, how many are really positive?

Precision=TP/(TP+FP)

* Recall/Sensitivity(True Positive rate) — Out of all the positive examples, how many are predicted as positive?

Recall=TP/(TP+FN)


* Specificity(True Negative rate)— Out of all the people that do not have the disease, how many got negative results?


* Specificity=TN/(TN+FP)

* False Positive rate=1-Specificity

* False Negative Rat=FN/(TP+FN)

False Negative Rate tells us what proportion of the positive class got incorrectly classified by the classifier


* F1 score=2/(1/Precision+1/Recall)
