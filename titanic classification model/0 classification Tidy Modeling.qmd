# titanic data

![](images/experience-at-titanic-pigeon-forge.jpg){width="519"}

data download form [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
train = read_csv("data/train.csv")

test=read_csv("data/test.csv")

```

Data have `r nrow(train)` record and `r ncol(train)` variable

```{r}

glimpse(train)
```

```{r}
train %>% group_by(Survived) %>% count()
```


## Measurement:

* Accuracy=TP+TN+FP+FN

* Precision --- Out of all the examples that predicted as positive, how many are really positive?

Precision=TP/(TP+FP)

* Recall/Sensitivity(True Positive rate) — Out of all the positive examples, how many are predicted as positive?

Recall=TP/(TP+FN)


* Specificity(True Negative rate)— Out of all the people that do not have the disease, how many got negative results?


* False Negative Rate tells us what proportion of the positive class got incorrectly classified by the classifier


Specificity=TN/(TN+FP)

* False Positive rate=1-Specificity

* False Negative Rat=FN/(TP+FN)
