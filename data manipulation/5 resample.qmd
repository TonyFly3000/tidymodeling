# MONTE CARLO CROSS-VALIDATION

for MCCV, this proportion of the data is randomly selected each time. This results in assessment sets that are not mutually exclusive

```{r}
#| eval: false
mc_resample<- mc_cv(data, prop = 9/10, times = 20)
mc_resample
```

# The Bootstrap

A bootstrap sample of the training set is a sample that is the same size as the training set but is drawn with replacement

bootstraps_resample<- bootstraps(data, times = 1000)
