# Hotel booking data
![](images/1.jpg){width="481"}

data download from github
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

hotels <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2020/2020-02-11/hotels.csv")
```
Data have `r nrow(hotels)` record  and `r ncol(hotels)` variable   
```{r}

glimpse(hotels)
```


```{r}
hotels %>% group_by(children) %>% count()
```

## Measurement:

* Accuracy=TP+TN+FP+FN

* Precision --- Out of all the examples that predicted as positive, how many are really positive?

Precision=TP/(TP+FP)

* Recall/Sensitivity(True Positive rate) — Out of all the positive examples, how many are predicted as positive?

Recall=TP/(TP+FN)


* Specificity(True Negative rate)— Out of all the people that do not have the disease, how many got negative results?


* False Negative Rate tells us what proportion of the positive class got incorrectly classified by the classifier


Specificity=TN/(TN+FP)

* False Positive rate=1-Specificity

* False Negative Rat=FN/(TP+FN)
